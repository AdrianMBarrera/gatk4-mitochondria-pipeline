# mitochondria-pipeline

### Purpose :
Workflow for SNP and INDEL variant calling on mitochondria.

### Requirements/expectations :
 - BAM or CRAM file
 - Median of the coverage over the autosome (if available, another central statistic would work too)
 - Reference fasta (along with its index and dictionary) is only required when input is a BAM
 - Default for `max_read_length` is 151, this is purely an optimization parameter and won't effect the results.

### Output :
 - A VCF file and its index
 - Addtional Metrics 
 - Optional realigned to chrM BAM

### Software version notes :
- GATK 4.1 
- Cromwell version support 
  - Successfully tested on v37 
  - Does not work on versions < v23 due to output syntax
